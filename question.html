<button class="accordionq"> What does Wilaw do?</button>
<div class="panelq">
  <p> Wilaw is an online marketplace where in-house teams, businesses and law firms (clients) can find lawyers to work flexibly on a project-by-project basis. Clients post assignments on the marketplace and Wilaw lawyers pitch for that work. Wilaw provides a complete platform to manage the work, invoice and pay. </p>
</div>

<hr>

<button class="accordionq"> How does Wilaw work?</button>
<div class="panelq">
  <p> Join Wilaw as a lawyer member and gain free access to the marketplace. It is only when you transact in the marketplace that you pay a service fee. </p>

<button class="accordionq"> What kind of work can I find on Wilaw? </button>
<div class="panelq">
  <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
</div>

<hr>

<button class="accordionq"> How do I know that an assignment has been posted that is relevant for me? </button>
<div class="panelq">
  <p> As a Wilaw member, you will receive a push notification (email) when an assignment has been posted in your practice area.

You can also search the site for assignments that are relevant to you.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<button class="accordionq"> How does invoicing and payment work ? </button>
<div class="panelq">
  <p> On the completion of the assignment, or as agreed with the client, you raise an invoice for the work completed within the Wilaw platform. The invoice is automatically sent to the client.

When the invoice is payed, you receive your fee, less the Wilaw service fee appropriate for your membership plan. Our payment gateway is with PromisePay. </p>

<button class="accordionq"> What kind of work can I find on Wilaw?</button>

  <p> The Wilaw marketplace is for commercial lawyers and legal advice, broadly defined. This includes all aspects of

Banking and finance
Corporate and commercial law
Dispute resolution and litigation
Employment
Government
Leasing
Mergers and acquisitions
Tax
The work may require a couple of hours, days or months. There is no upper or lower limit to the amount of time the assignment may take, or the invoice amount.

Wilaw is not the right platform for criminal law, family law, residential conveyancing or probate.</p>
